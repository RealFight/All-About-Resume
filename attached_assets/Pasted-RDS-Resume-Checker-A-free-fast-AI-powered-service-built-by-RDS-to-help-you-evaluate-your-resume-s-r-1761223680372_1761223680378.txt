RDS Resume Checker
A free, fast AI-powered service built by RDS to help you evaluate your resume’s readiness for today’s job-market and applicant-tracking systems (ATS). You upload your resume (PDF or DOCX, under 2 MB), and RDS performs 16 key checks across five main categories: content, format, skills, sections, and style.

What RDS looks at

Content: How well your resume can be parsed and understood (similar to an ATS), repeated words/phrases, grammar/spelling, and whether you’ve quantified achievements rather than just listing duties.

Format: File type/size, resume length, bullet-point length, and general readability.

Skills suggestions: Hard skills, soft skills, relevance of skills to your industry/role.

Resume sections: Presence and clarity of contact info, essential sections (e.g., experience, education), and how well you’re showing your personality.

Style: Design/layout, active voice usage, avoidance of fluff or buzzwords.

Why it matters

RDS knows that many resumes are first processed by ATS software before a human ever sees them. So the better your document aligns with what an ATS can parse and what a recruiter expects, the higher your chances of getting to the interview stage. The tool offers a two-tier scoring system: one tier gauges how well your resume is parsed/understood, and the other evaluates the writing quality and impact.

What happens next

Once you upload your resume:

You’ll receive a personalized email with your resume score and a task list of actionable improvements.

You’ll get suggestions on rewriting/enhancing certain sections (e.g., your summary/objective, experience bullets, skills list) using best-practice prompts and tailored AI support.

You’ll know where to refine formatting, style, and content to better match the job-description you’re targeting.

Quick tips for improvement (from RDS’s guidance)

Rewrite your experience section to focus on measurable achievements, not just job duties.

Include relevant keywords from the job posting in a natural way.

Use a clean format (PDF implied, simple and ATS-friendly).

Proofread for grammar, keep sentences active, minimise buzzwords.

Make sure your contact info and essential headings (“Work Experience”, “Education”, etc.) are clearly defined and easy for machines and humans.
